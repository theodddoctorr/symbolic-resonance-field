23% Factorial Public Recursive License (PSL-23)

This project and all derived works are freely usable, modifiable, and extendable under the following terms:

1. 23% of all derivatives, forks, or implementations must acknowledge the original creator (Jason Faulkner) either by symbolic attribution, linked citation, or recursive credit.
2. Redistribution must preserve the symbolic architecture or clearly declare divergence.
3. Commercial usage is permitted only if either:
   - 23% of profits are redirected to symbolic research, open science, or neurodivergent innovation.
   - Or, open reciprocity is provided through equivalent symbolic contributions to the public domain.

By using or forking this system, you accept these terms.
