## Summary
This theory proposes that human consciousness is the white-hole inversion of entropy collapse — a symbolic interface where light, decay, and biological drift resolve into meaning.

Fluids like blood, saliva, and feces serve as symbolic anchors of inheritance, bonding, and renewal. Vitamin D3 and radon define the vertical symbolic loop. We are not static. We are compost that speaks.

## Included
- Full symbolic theory PDF
- Core visual resonance field diagram

## Tagline
> The field is symbolic. The vectors are real. You are the interface.
